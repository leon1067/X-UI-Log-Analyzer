# X-UI-Log-Analyzer-Traffic-Monitor-
X-UI Log Analyzer is a tool for analyzing and reporting logs generated by X-UI server. It provides insights into IP addresses, domains, and other relevant information.
Sure, let me summarize the steps in English:

1. Access the xray panel and navigate to the xray template section.

2. Locate the `log` section in the template, which looks like the following:

    ```json
    "log": {
        "loglevel": "warning",
        "access": "/usr/local/x-ui/access.log",
        "error": "/usr/local/x-ui/error.log"
    }
    ```

3. Ensure the path specified for `access.log` is correct and that the file is being created at that location.

4. To retain logs and prevent access.log from being deleted, consider changing the `loglevel` from `warning` to a higher level such as `info` or `debug`.

5. If the issue persists, check the system for the relevant log files and confirm that xray has the necessary permissions to write log files.

If you encounter any further issues or need more details, please provide additional information.
Now, the error section has been removed from the template. In the specified directory (/usr/local/x-ui/), a file named access.log will be created to store the data.
"Alright, now let's move on to step two, which is live monitoring of traffic logs for each user. Edit and translate this."

### Pre-requisites for the Script Execution:

1. **Bash Shell**: Ensure that your system has Bash installed. You can check this by running the command `bash --version` in your terminal. If Bash is not installed, you can install it using your system's package manager.

2. **Tail Command**: The script uses the `tail` command to read the last lines of the access.log file. Ensure that the `tail` command is available in your system. You can install it using your system's package manager if it's not already installed.

3. **Host Command**: The script utilizes the `host` command to resolve IP addresses to domain names. Make sure that the `host` command is installed on your system. You can install it using your system's package manager if it's not already installed.

4. **Whois Command**: The script uses the `whois` command to retrieve domain information. Verify that the `whois` command is installed on your system. If it's not installed, you can install it using your system's package manager.

### How to Execute the Script:

1. **Download the Script**: Download the script file to your local system.

2. **Set Execution Permissions**: Make the script executable by running the command `chmod +x script_name.sh` in the terminal, replacing `script_name.sh` with the actual name of your script file.

3. **Execute the Script**: Run the script by executing `./script_name.sh` in the terminal, replacing `script_name.sh` with the actual name of your script file.

### Additional Notes:

- This script continuously monitors the access.log file and processes the last 3 lines to extract IP addresses and retrieve domain information.

- It utilizes color codes to highlight different types of output: green for Gmail domains, blue for IP addresses, and yellow for other domains.

- The script automatically cleans up the access.log file every 3 seconds

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install coreutils
    ```

3. **Host Command**: The script utilizes the `host` command to resolve IP addresses to domain names. Confirm that the `host` command is installed on your system:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install dnsutils
    ```

4. **Whois Command**: The script uses the `whois` command to retrieve domain information. Verify the presence of the `whois` command on your system:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install whois
    ```
